## Overview

This project involves creating a profile card that displays user information and social media links. The card is styled with CSS and uses Flexbox for layout management. The card includes an avatar, name, location, a brief description, and social media buttons that are vertically stacked and centered. The design is responsive, ensuring that it looks good on various screen sizes.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to:

- Use CSS Flexbox to center elements both horizontally and vertically.
- Apply CSS variables for consistent styling.
- Implement responsive design with media queries.

Here is an example of the Flexbox centering technique I used:

```css
.social-links {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

### Continued Development

For future projects, I plan to:

- Enhance accessibility features.
- Experiment with CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
- Implement advanced JavaScript functionalities.
